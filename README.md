<h1>CALCULATOR</h1>

This repo can be clone and run with a 'npm start'.

You can use your keyboard or click on buttons to use it.
This is a simple calculator made for my personal practice.
At the beginning, it was supposed to be a dashboard with many differents "daily apps" (calculator, to-do list, etc ..., as you can find in phones) but I decided to change my mind.
This dashboard will come soon, stay tuned !
